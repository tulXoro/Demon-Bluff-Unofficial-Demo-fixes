# Demon Bluff - Unofficial Demo Fixes

## Description

This is an unofficial patch for the playtest of [Demon Bluff](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3522600/Demon_Bluff/), which provides small general fixes. It does not fix all bugs (and it likely won't ever try to), but if there is an important bug that affects mods or vanilla gameplay, this patch will try to eventually fix them.

This mod is ***mod agnostic***. It may or may not work with other mods depending on how they are implemented.

## Why?

Although the game is still a ***demo/playtest***, I wanted to make small improvements for my own mods. Since I thought others might want the fixes, I decided to make it a separate stand-alone mod. The goal is a compatibility-friendly patch but I can not guarantee if it works with mods others have made.

## Current Fixes

- Game not ending when health is low
