# Demon Bluff - Unofficial Demo Fixes

## Description

This is an unofficial patch for the playtest of [Demon Bluff](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3522600/Demon_Bluff/), which provides some fixes while the game prepares for it's official release. The focus is on fixing issues related to modding and a few other bugs encountered during the playtest.

This mod is ***mod agnostic***. It should work fine with or without mods.

## Why?

Originally, I wanted to make small fixes for my original mod, [Reveal Dilemma](https://github.com/tozeon/Demon-Bluff-Reveal-Dilemma-mod). I thought that some other people might want the fixes, so I decided to release it as a standalone mod instead of integrating it with Reveal Dilemma.

## Current Fixes

- Game not ending when health is low

## Planned Fixes

- (mod focused) Killing other characters will not force player to use their pick ability

## Installation

### ***Prerequisites***

You will need to download [Melon Loader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/).
You will also need to game installed, of course.

### Directions

1. Open Melon Loader. Select/search "Demon Bluff Playtest".
2. Enable Nightly builds and install.
3. Launch the game first without any mods.
4. Navigate to the game directory and you'll see the `mods` folder. Drag and drop this mod's `.dll` file in there and run the game.
5. Enjoy the game.
